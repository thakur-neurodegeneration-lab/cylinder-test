The  project aims to automate the scoring of rodent cylinder test, commonly used to evaluate unilateral lesions in neuromotor circuitry.

Although not tested for other behaviours, the model architecture seems suited to be adaptable to numerous behavioural assays, over and above cylinder test, such as gait analysis, rearing and grooming behaviours in open field, etc.

Also provided are sample video files and analysis file generated throughout the analysis process.
